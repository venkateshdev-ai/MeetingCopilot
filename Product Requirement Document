Product Requirements Document (PRD): Meeting Optimization Copilot
Project Phase: POC / Discovery Validated 
Product Consultant: Venkateshvaran Mohandass Technical Stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Shadcn/UI, RAG Architecture

1. Executive Summary
The Meeting Optimization Copilot is an AI-native workspace designed to solve "Documentation Debt" in digital studios. It autonomously transforms raw discovery meeting 
transcripts into high-fidelity technical artifacts, ensuring that 100% of "Ground Truth" discussed with stakeholders is preserved in the final development backlog.

2. Problem Statement
 >>Documentation Latency: PMs spend 5–8 hours weekly manually synthesizing meeting notes into tickets.
 >>Context Fragmentation: Critical technical nuances discussed in discovery are often lost during manual transcription to Jira/ADO.
 >>Stakeholder Misalignment: Ambiguity in meeting summaries leads to scope creep and wasted engineering cycles.

3. Goals & Success Metrics
 >>Efficiency: Reduce time-to-documentation from 120 minutes to <10 minutes per session.
 >>Accuracy: Maintain a >90% human-verified accuracy rate for AI-generated User Stories.
 >>Reliability: Achieve 0% "Hallucination Rate" by grounding all outputs in RAG-verified transcript data.

4. Functional Requirements
  4.1 Ingestion & Processing
>>Multi-Format Support: System must accept .vtt, .txt, and .json transcript formats.
>>Speaker Diarization Recognition: The LLM must distinguish between different stakeholders to attribute requirements correctly.

  4.2 AI-Native Analysis (The RAG Engine)
>>Intent Extraction: Use LLMs to categorize dialogue into "Business Goals," "Functional Requirements," and "Technical Constraints."
>>Constraint Identification: Automatically flag mentions of specific tech stacks (e.g., Shopify Plus, ERP, PIM) as defined in the Lazer PM role requirements.
>>Contextual Retrieval: Utilize vector embeddings to pull only relevant transcript sections when generating specific user stories.

  4.3 Artifact Generation
>>PRD Auto-Generation: Create a structured summary including "Current State," "Proposed Solution," and "Success Metrics."
>>User Story Mapping: Generate stories in the As-a/I-want/So-that format.
>>Gherkin-Style Acceptance Criteria: Provide detailed "Given/When/Then" scenarios for every generated ticket.

5. User Experience & Design Logic
Based on the Balsamiq discovery phase:
>>Analysis Hub: A split-view interface where the raw transcript is pinned to the left and AI insights are displayed on the right for immediate verification.
>>Artifact Editor: A rich-text editor allowing PMs to refine AI-generated content before exporting to external tools.
>>Balsamiq Proof: The user journey was validated using MeetingPOC_wireframe.pdf to ensure a frictionless "One-Click Synthesis" flow.

6. Technical Logic & Prompt Engineering
6.1 Agentic Workflow Logic
The system employs a multi-agent prompt strategy:
>>The Analyst: Scans for business value and high-level intent.
>>The Technical Architect: Breaks down intent into modular technical requirements.
>>The Quality Auditor: Validates the output against the transcript to ensure no requirements were "invented" by the LLM.

6.2 Security & Privacy
>>PII Masking: Personally Identifiable Information is scrubbed before being sent to the LLM.
>>Data Ephemerality: Transcripts are stored in temporary vector memory and purged after the session ends to protect client confidentiality.

7. Future Roadmap
>>Phase 2: Direct API integration with Jira and Azure DevOps for seamless backlog pushing.
>>Phase 3: Real-time "Meeting Health" monitoring to flag when a discussion is drifting out of scope.
